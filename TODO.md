# TODO:

<h2>EZDeadlockModManager.py</h2>
- [ ]  FEATURE: Add alphabetical sort for installed mods
- [ ]  FEATURE: Remove all mods/turn off mod buttons (either from addons directory or change gameinfo.gi file)
- [ ]  FEATURE: Show warning when 99+ mods enabled -> we already only add 99 mods (and display a message when doing so), so this is just extra but still useful
- [ ]  FEATURE: Add drag and drop for files straight from file explorer
- [ ]  FIX: Need to detect the other rar tools (like 7z.exe) using RAR_TOOL_REGISTRY_PATHS, and find a way on linux (setting the rar tool manually works however)
- [ ]  FIX: Add highlight for installed mod search (the search works + it scrolls to the correct item, but the highlight currently isn't visible)
- [ ]  FEATURE: Add vpk viewer/maker -> use vpk module
- [ ]  FEATURE: Add multiple profiles

<h2>deadlock_mod_browser.py</h2>
- [ ]  FEATURE: Add sort for mods in the browser -> use the _sSort parameter, which has allowed values: new, default, updated
- [ ]  FEATURE: Add a page number
- [ ]  FIX: Sounds still play after mod browser is closed, we want to close the sound and keep the mod browser object
- [ ]  FEATURE: Cache old pages/Preload pages?

<h2>deadlock_mod_browser_features.py</h2>
- [ ]  FIX: Make the download button's text change dynamically based on download state, requires a reference to be passed into _start_download_thread()
- [ ]  FEATURE: Blur the image preview if the visibility is set to False

<h2>settings_window.py</h2>
- [ ]  FEATURE: Add a way to scan for already downloaded mods -> and then rewrite modpack file (implement this to replace creation of blank modpack file upon error)
- [ ]  FEATURE: Add a way to delete old download folders if they exist, these should only exist if a user exits during a download
